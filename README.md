ðŸš¦ How to run the application
Prerequisites
The system has Node.js installed

Run the MySQL server locally

Git for version control

Gradually set up
Start the backend server

bash
Navigate to the project directory in the VSCode terminal
node server.js
You should see:

text
The server is running at http://localhost:3000

Initialize the database (first setup)

bash

node init_database.js
Visit the website

Keep the server running in the terminal

Open File Explorer and navigate to the client folder

Important Note
The server must be running: The website requires the backend server to be active.   If you close the terminal running node server.js, the website will stop working.
